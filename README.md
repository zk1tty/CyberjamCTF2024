🧪 ZKitty and Tippi Fifestarr hacked together this open-source, update to Patrick Collins'  Star Wars CTF using Scaffold-Eth-2 (a toolkit for building decentralized applications). It's designed to make it easier for developers and security curious attendees at the 2024 CypherCon to create and deploy smart contracts. 


## Interacting with Contracts

To interact with the contracts, you can use the "debug contracts" function provided in the application. This function allows you to test and interact with the deployed smart contracts.

## Main Page Features

1. Display Two Teams Image:
   - [x] Display images of the two teams in medium size to represent them visually.
   - [ ] Center a current score counter for each team.

2. Leaderboard:
   - [ ] Display a list of the players leaderboard with the following information:
     - [ ] Ranking #
     - [x] Codename & address
     - [x] Team
     - [ ] Small dynamic NFT image
     - [ ] Score

3. Refresh Button:
   - [ ] Include a refresh button that triggers a read function using the useContractRead hook to fetch the latest scores or leaderboard data.

4. Stretch Goals:
   - [ ] Timer countdown to the end of the game.
   - [ ] Graph the scores over time
   - [ ] Add a "Join Game" button to allow new players to join the game (redirect to debug contracts)

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- 🧱 [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git
cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
